# pbzx stream parser

This repository is a fork of PHPdev32's implementation of the `pbzx` stream
parser program of which the original source code can be found [here][source].
Pbzx is a format employed in later versions of OSX disk images (starting with
10.10) to encode payload data in `.pkg` files. Pbzx unpacks `.pkg` files and
outputs to stdout to be unpacked with `cpio`. Note that `.pkg` files are plain
`.xar` archives.

    pbzx SomePkg.pkg | cpio -i  # or
    pbzx -n Payload  | cpio -i

# dependencies

    libc clang xar liblzma

# install

To compile pbzx, do

    make

To install pbzx, do

    sudo make install

    Configure installation directory with PREFIX in Makefile. (Default is /usr/local.)


> If `<lzma.h>` or `<xar/xar.h>` are missing, install them with [Homebrew]
