# pbzx stream parser

This repository is a fork of PHPdev32's implementation of the `pbzx` stream
parser program of which the original source code can be found [here][source].
Pbzx is a format employed in later versions of OSX disk images (starting with
10.10) to encode payload data in `.pkg` files. Pbzx unpacks `.pkg` files and
outputs to stdout to be unpacked with `cpio`. Note that `.pkg` files are plain
`.xar` archives.

    pbzx SomePkg.pkg | cpio -i  # or
    pbzx -n Payload  | cpio -i

To compile `pbzx`, do

    clang -llzma -lxar -I /usr/local/include pbzx.c -o pbzx

> If `<lzma.h>` or `<xar/xar.h>` are missing, install them with [Homebrew]
> using
>
>     brew install xz && brew link xz

You can also install `pbzx` with [Homebrew] using

    brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NiklasRosenstein/pbzx/master/pbzx.rb
